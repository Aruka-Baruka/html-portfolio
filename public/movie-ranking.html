<h1>Must-watch films according to Aruka-Baruka:D</h1>
<h2>Here is the list of films that are must see!</h2>
<hr/>

<h3>Monster-in-Law</h3>
<p>Silly fun, light movie to watch at the evening. I've watched it at least 10 times and haven't got bored yet. Would like to hightlight Wanda Sykes' acting and her chemistry with Jane Fonda was fantastic. Althought there is a tug of war between a mother and the daughter-in-law, it is conveyed in a light hearted and funsy way without harted or wickedness.  </p>

<h3>Ugly truth</h3>
<p>Funny but would not recommend it to those people who get easily offended. The film is full of gender stereotypes that perfectly reveal Abby's control freak character and Mike's attitude towards women as if he is ordering some food.  </p>

<h3>The ratatouille</h3>
<p>Simply because it reminds me of my mom. warm and fun movie is a must-have in a family circle. Also, I am a gourmet and the creators were able to convey the delicious taste of Parisian dishes through a screen. I CAN FEEL THIS SCENT!</p>
